# FlyCam

## Project Abstract
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have revealed their unprecedented potential for commercial, military and civil-government utilization in a wide range of applications ranging from monitoring climate change to carrying out search operations after natural disasters, photography, filming, and delivering goods. In this project we aim to identify and detect faces as well as objects given as inputs using Computer Vision. It is then used for photography and tracking purposes.

- NVIDIA Jetson Nano
- Pixhawk PX4 2.4.8
- F-450 Drone Frame
- 920kV BLDC motors
